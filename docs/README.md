# IgANets - Isogeometric Analysis Networks

**IgANets** (Isogeometric Analysis Networks) is a C++ library that
combines Isogeometric Analysis with deep operator learning. It builds
upon the C++ API of the Torch library and is written in C++20. The
library aims to provide an easy to use, user-friendly and yet
computationally efficient framework for implementing IgANet
applications.
